## Strava Activity Histogram (Postman + Chart.js)

This project visualizes my workout activity data from Strava using the Strava API, Postman, and Chart.js.
The goal was to explore workout duration trends over time by transforming raw API responses into an interactive histogram.
The visualization displays elapsed workout time (minutes) by date, highlighting patterns such as increased training duration in later months while maintaining consistent activity frequency.
